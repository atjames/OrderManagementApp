Required JAR files to run our program:
JDatePicker - https://jdatepicker.org/about/
How to install JAR files in IntelliJ - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-add-external-jar-file-to-an-intellij-idea-project/

All our UML diagrams and Use Case diagrams can be found in the Pre-Code-Work (Use Cases, Class Diagrams, ect) file in the repo. You can find all other project information such as how the features work and group contribution at our Wiki. 

Due to some unfortunate circumstances with one of our groupmembers we did not implement features 2 and 6. Some of the implementation was hardcoded throughout the project.

Thanks!
